Start two edge servers (A and B) each on its own computer.

Test:

1. all links work 
2. Link from A node to B node
3. Link from A logic node to B node
4. Link from A node to B Logic node
5. Link from A Logic node to B Logic node
6. Link from A Logic node to B Logic node, to another B logic node to a B node.
7. the above node and logic node tests with B and world object
8. above tests with tools that have been moved from B to world object
9. move tools between world object and B and test if all links to nodes and logic nodes stay working
10. all logic blocks
11. all logic block settings
12. all tools work and have the right frame size
13. all tools have the right UI behavior -> video recording crashes 
14. Link tools with A hardware interface values and see that they have the right values when you close and open the toolbox
15. that all tools show the right nodes when dropped on objects and world
16. check that all tool nodes for each tool are working 
17. Check that the distance scaling work for all tools 
18. add 50 tools into the space and check how the distance scaling works 
19. register world object and see if all tools are at the right position 
20. register world object and check if all tools on an object are at the right spot
21. add tools to an object without registering world object then register world object and see if the position is right 
22. register world object then add tools to object. close the app, reopen and then only lock at the object and see if the tools are at the right spot.
